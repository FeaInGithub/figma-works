**Welcome to my Figma portfolio!**

In this collection, you'll find a glimpse into my creative journey during my college years. I want to be upfront about the fact that not every project here is a shining example â€“ most of them were early experiments and works in progress.

My Figma experience has been a solo adventure, driven by my individual learning path. As a result, you might notice that my work has evolved and shifted in various directions.

*This was my first attempt at creating a working prototype, and I haven't fully grasped Figma yet. I initially set out to make a wireframe, but somehow ended up with a prototype. My knowledge of Figma is still in its early stages. We were working on our capstone project, and our professor needed to get a glimpse of what the final system would look like. So, we decided to put together a prototype to showcase our vision. As you can see below, our system needed three users:*

*This was where I discovered that I actually enjoyed the process of prototyping in Figma, even though it was still more of a learning experience. I must admit, I don't consider myself a proficient designer, and I don't think I possess a particularly artistic personality trait, but I found the prototyping aspect intriguing.*

*During this phase, I was still refining my skills in crafting effective website layouts.*

I find myself at a bit of a crossroads because I lack clear guidance at the moment. However, I'm optimistic that with more experience and the guidance of others, I tend to excel. I thrive when I have someone to follow and learn from. With time and more opportunities, I believe I can make significant progress and potentially enhance my skills in this area.
